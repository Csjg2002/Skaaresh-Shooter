<h1>Skaaresh Shooter</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The year is 2359. Earth is a distant memory. Colonies were sent to the far reaches of the Home Zone, nearby stars with habitable planets. The first colonists established small settlements to restart civilisation, with many systems thriving. On the planet Skaaresh, however, those attempting to build foundations found themselves battling the harsh climate of an inhospitable world and alien creatures determined to reclaim what was once theirs.

Developed for a university assignment based on a given brief, this game marked my first experience with C# and Unity. As the sole developer, I gained experience using both Visual Studio and the Unity engine, which has been invaluable in my game development journey.
